     Cmaj7                 Am
More than peace and love on the planet Earth

  Dm7                      G
Whoahh come on and sing it with me

[Peridot] Sing?

    Cmaj7                   Am
[Steven] The words relate to the key

[Peridot] Key?

    Dm7               G
[Steven] If it's a pattern if it's a pattern

Cmaj7                  Am
Then just repeat after me

[Peridot] That's so easy

    Cmaj7                  Am
[Steven] Yeah but that's what's fun about it

Dm7
You should write something, you should write a song!

     G
[Peridot] About what?

    Cmaj7                   Am
[Steven] Whatever you're thinking

                           Dm7 G
[Peridot] I guess we're already here

              Cmaj7 Am
I guess we already know

                      Dm7 G
We've all got something to fear

                 Cmaj7  Am
We've all got nowhere to go

                Dm7 G
I think you're all insane!

            Cmaj7  Am
But I guess I am too

         Dm7
Anybody would be

        G                   Cmaj7
If they were stuck on Earth with you!

             Am
[Steven] Hehehehe yes!

Cmaj7                Am
Peace and war on the planet Earth

    Dm7         G

    Cmaj7       Am
[Steven] Is there anything that's worth more

     Dm7         G
[Peridot] Is there anything that's worth more

Fm6 Fdim7
    Flexibility, love, and trust

Am7
Here comes a thought, that might alarm you

Fmaj7              E E7
What someone said, and how it harmed you

Cmaj7
Something you did, that failed to be charming

Fmaj7                  E  E7
Things that you said are, Suddenly swarming

    Dm7               G7
And oh! You're losing sight

              Cmaj7
You're losing touch

                 Cdim7                    Dm7
All these little things seem to matter so much

             G7
That they confuse you.

Dm7          G7
That I might lose you.

Fmaj7                          E  E7
Take a moment remind yourself, to take
 a moment to find yourself

Fmaj7
Take a moment to ask yourself,

Fm6 Fdim7
if  this is how we fall apart

         Cmaj7
But it's not, but it's not,

<h3>Do it for her</h3>


Dm   G
You do it for him.

     C     Cmaj7
And you would do it again.

Dm              G
You do it for her, that is to say,

 C
You'll do it for him.

Dm        Am
Keep your stance wide.

Dm        Am
Keep your body lowered.

Dm        G
As you're moving forward,

C       B7     Em
Balance is the key.

B7
Right foot. Left foot.

Em     B7
Now go even faster.

Em            Dm
And as you're moving backwards,

C         Em      Dm
Keep your eyes on me.

 Am           Dm
[Connie] Keep my stance wide. (Good)

Am            Dm
Keep my body lowered. (Right)

G
As I'm moving forward...

C            B7
[Pearl] Concentrate!

        Em
Don't you want him to live!?

     B7
[Connie] Right foot; Left foot

Em                      B7
[Pearl] Yes, but put your whole body into it!

Em                   Dm             C
Everything you have, everything you are,

   B7
You've got to give

E7
On the battlefield.

   Am
When everything is chaos.

             E7
And you have nothing but the way you feel,
         Am
 your strategy and a sword.

         G
You just think about the life you'll

          C    A7
have together after the war!

       Dm   G
And then you do it for her,

            Em   A
That's how you know you can win.

Dm              G
You do it for her, that is to say,

 C
You'll do it for him.

Dm        Am
Deep down you know,

Dm          Am
You weren't built for fighting.

Dm       G
But that doesn't mean

C      B7       Em
You're not prepared to try.

B7
What they don't know

Em      B7
Is your real advantage,

Em       Dm
When you live for someone

C         Em       Dm
You're prepared to die

   Am
[Connie] Deep down I know

Dm       Am            Dm
That I'm just a human. (True)

G               C
But I know that I can

  B7        Em
draw my sword and fight!

B7               Em
With my short existence, (Good)

B7                 Em
I can make a difference. (Yes, excellent!)

Dm
I can be there for him.

C     Em             Dm
I can be his knight.

G               C
I can do it for him.

C7              Dm
[Both] You'd do it for her.

G                  C
[Pearl] Okay, now do that again.(Yes, ma'am.)

Cmaj7         Dm               G
You do it for her, and now you say:

        Cmaj7

  Em         G7    Cmaj7
wait to see the person you are together.

     B7
If you give it a chance you can do a huge

   Em    G7    Cmaj7
 dance because you are a giant woman.

   F            G7
You might even like being

  C                    E7
together and if you don't it won't be forever.

   F                    G7
But if it were me, I'd really

  Cmaj7          E7
wanna be a giant woman, A giant woman!

This is Garnet. Back together.

Cm7                 Bbm7
And I'm never goin' down at

 Eb7          Abmaj7
 the hands of the likes of you,

        G7
Because I'm so much better.

Cm7
And every part of me is saying 'Go get her.'

Abmaj7                    G7
The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules.

Cm                 Bbm7        Eb7   Abmaj7
Come at me without any of your fancy tools.

Can't you see that my relationship is stable?

We are gonna stay like this forever.

If you break us apart, we'll just

            Ebmaj7
 come back newer.

Everything they care about is what I am.
